买股票，考虑到收入为负的情况
贪婪法，一个值记录最低价格，一个值记录最大收益
https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/stock-price
Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:

The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

  stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
# returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

No "shorting"—you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

    # make sure we have at least 2 prices
    if len(stock_prices_yesterday) < 2:
        raise IndexError('Getting a profit requires at least 2 prices')

    # we'll greedily update min_price and max_profit, so we initialize
    # them to the first price and the first possible profit
    min_price = stock_prices_yesterday[0]
    max_profit = stock_prices_yesterday[1] - stock_prices_yesterday[0]

    for index, current_price in enumerate(stock_prices_yesterday):

        # skip the first (0th) time
        # we can't sell at the first time, since we must buy first,
        # and we can't buy and sell at the same time!
        # if we took this out, we'd try to buy /and/ sell at time 0.
        # this would give a profit of 0, which is a problem if our
        # max_profit is supposed to be /negative/--we'd return 0!
        if index == 0:
            continue

        # see what our profit would be if we bought at the
        # min price and sold at the current price
        potential_profit = current_price - min_price

        # update max_profit if we can do better
        max_profit = max(max_profit, potential_profit)

        # update min_price so it's always
        # the lowest price we've seen so far
